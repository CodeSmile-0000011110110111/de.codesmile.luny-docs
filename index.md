# Luny Documentation

Luny allows you to write Lua scripts in Unity instead of C#. Both Editor and Runtime APIs are available.

Lua scripts will hot reload after every change, enabling you to prototype and explore a lot faster than with C#.

Please consider sponsoring Luny on [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/c/codesmile) or [GitHub](https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111). 

For more info visit [LunyScript.com](https://lunyscript.com) and the [Luny Unity package GitHub repository](https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/de.codesmile.luny).
